# Windows 10 Calculator

A knock-off of the Windows 10 Calculator made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## General Info

Inspired by the Odin project. Created by myself to practice and demonstrate some of my current JS, CSS, and general Web Developer abilities.

Motivation for using ES6 classes for this project came from [WebDevSimplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator). The purpose of this project was to improve my programmer problem solving skills and to reinforce my coding style to use best practices.

For this project, I copied [WebDevSimplifed's initial calculator](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator) by hand-copying only when absolutely necessary. For the rest, I would seek to figure out how to implement his class methods or CSS styles myself. Afterwards, I then added additional calculator features, changed the style to match the Windows 10 Calculator, and simplified WebDev's calculator computational logic.

The point of this project was never to reinvent the wheel, rather to strengthen my coding skills and to promote coding with best practices.
